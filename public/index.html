                Tforx reimagines traditional assumptions of spacetime in video, transforming time from a liminal experience into a tangible visual progression through space. By displaying time in the spatial dimension and space in the temporal dimension, it offers viewers a radically new way of observing the past, present, and future. Tforx enables viewers to reexamine their everyday perceptions of time and space, while offering them a unique glimpse into a perception of time that lies beyond our human sensory capability.

                Tforx takes a cubist approach to the medium of film. Throughout history, cubist artists such as Braque and Picasso strove for a new way to see, and the result was a flattening of the three- dimensional world. This movement mangled renaissance perspective, which since the 15th- century had been the only technique used to represent our world. In the eyes of the cubists, a violin, a vase, or a jazz band were more than what initially met the eye. Subjects were studied from all angles and then painted as two-dimensional objects –– a method uniquely appropriate to the two-dimensional canvas utilized by painters.

                Tforx incorporates a similar technique, only we add time to the equation, observing it as the cubist painters observed their subjects. Each frame is a depiction of the full temporal length of the video, but only a sliver of the observed space. As the video progresses, the pieces come together and create a subverted vision of our observable dimensions. This flattening of time shows the adjacency of cause and effect and encourages the viewer to realize the interconnectedness of time and space.

                It is vital that we reimagine the world and look at our lives from new angles every so often. Stagnation in politics, technology, science and art is uninspiring at best and dangerous at worst. With Tforx, we are regarding the dynamic intersection of art and technology as a tool capable of creating new ways of understanding our world and confronting the issues within it. Defamiliarizing traditional perceptions of spacetime forces the viewer to reexamine their relationship with our contemporary world and its future, inspiring possibilities and solutions beyond our wildest imaginations.
